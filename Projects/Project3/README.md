I don't have very many notes but I did have to try creating this stack 6 times and the main error was not getting to Private IP Address correct within the subnet range. I started with 10.0.0.0 and 10.0.0.15 and those were wrong because it was the end of the ranges but not within. After adjustments stack was created. I also was unsure if i had to change anything for the security groups because the first three looked correct after research.
